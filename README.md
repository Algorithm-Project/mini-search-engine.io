The front-end of the project was built using HTML, CSS and BootStrap. The Login and Sign
Up buttons on the top right will redirect the user to the authentication page (fig.1). The
Navigation Bar (fig.1) has been built using BootStrap where the Search Bar is a form
wherein on typing the query, you get relevant results (fig.2). We have used a property of
CSS called “border-radius” to smoothen the edges of the page. The Search Button has
been built using a bootstrap class “btn btn-lg btn-primary”. The image above the search bar
is a simple h1 tag which can also be replaced with an image or SVG.

Factors affecting the order in which the web pages appear (Search Engine Optimization)
(fig.2) include number of backlinks, authenticity of results, user traffic on the web pages, etc.
In fig. , the black link bar under each displayed web page shows the number of backlinks
relevant to search that a page has. For e.g., if I type in a five words long string in the search
bar, the backlinks indicate the number of words in that string that are absent from a
particular web page. A bar below the Search Bar shows the total number of results (relevant
web pages) found and the time taken for the search. When a keyword learn is searched, e.g.
‘learn’, all the related keywords are searched in addition to the entered keyword. Words
relevant to ‘learn’ would be ‘learned’, ‘learning’, etc. We plan on including a tab that would
display the page with the maximum number of keywords matched. The web page links are
displayed using BootStrap’s “col and row property”. The whole page has been divided into
twelve parts wherein links contain nine of the parts and the remaining three parts are left
unused. “Href Tag” is used inside an “anchor tag” which is used to fetch data dynamically
after crawling and to show the results accordingly. The “big blue links” represent the content
inside the web pages and below them is the actual link of the particular web page (which is
wrapped around the anchor tag) Clicking on either of those will redirect the user to the
corresponding web page.
